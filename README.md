# Example plugin floating widget for Android
I found some difficulties working with widget using cord. So decide to create your own plugin, making it easy to use and customize 'Floating Widget'
## How to install
To install copy to the line below:

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/EmersonAlves/FloatingWidgetCordova
```

## Get Permission
to request permission to use the floating widget function
```
 FloatingWidget.getPermission(success,fail);
```

## Open floating widget
to request permission to use the floating widget function
```
 FloatingWidget.open(success,fail,config);
```
